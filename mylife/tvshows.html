<h2>Pretty Little Liars</h2>

<p>
	Pretty Little Liars is a really good show. It is about 4 girls, who are getting these random text messages from this anonymous person after their best friend happens to dissapear. I like this show because it is kind of suspensful and you never what might happen next or what secret is going to come out. 
</p>
<h3>Once Upon A Time</h3>
<img src="ouat.jpg" width="250px">
<p>
	Once Upon A Time is a sort of action packed show about fairytales actually coming to life. This is a really good show. It has some humor which is what I like, and I like how the story goes from the present to the past and how each episode has one main character in mind and the past will be based on that character.

<h4>Quantico</h4>
<img src="quantico.jpg" width="250px">
<p>
	Quantico is an action packed show about an FBI agent who is accused of terrorizing NYC. She now has to find out who the real culprit is and why are they framing her. Some of the FBI agents from the academy Quatnico now turn on her but her closest friends are sided besides her.
