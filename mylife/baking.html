<p>
	Oreo balls are a wonderful dessert to have. It is also very simple to make. No baking necessary. All you do is take one pack of double stuffed oreos and make them all crumbly. Then you take one pack of Philidelphia cream cheese, and combine it all together. You make little tiny balls with the mixture you have created, and put them in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes. After that, you take the candy melts that you have which you can getr from Micheals and melt them. You take the oreo balls and put them in the candy melts and take them out once they are fully covered and put them in the fridge to cool. Whenever you want to take it out, it will be ready for you.
